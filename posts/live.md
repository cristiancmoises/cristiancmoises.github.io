My OpenBsd Portfolio

### Creation
I needed a cool portfolio... so i created [this](https://cristiancezarmoises.vercel.app).
Well. My hacking spirit ever want learn more; then i use threejs and reactjs to create a interative portfolio (check [here](https://interativo.vercel.app)).
But it's not sufficient for me.
After a few months of hard work i finished one of my best creations: A interactive [OpenBSD portfolio](https://live-one.vercel.app) with another two websites(listed above) inside.
